## Overview

This system facilitates the real-time tracking, management, and coordination of drones during disaster relief efforts. It integrates various data sources, including seismic sensors, weather monitoring systems, and satellite imagery, to optimize flight paths, ensure efficient supply drops, and improve response times in disaster zones.

## Features

- **Real-Time Drone Tracking**: Track the locations of drones and monitor their mission status in real-time.
- **Automated Supply Drops**: Manage and automate the coordination of supply deliveries to remote areas.
- **Optimized Flight Paths**: Use weather and seismic data to dynamically adjust flight paths and avoid obstacles.
- **Mission Status Updates**: Get real-time updates on drone deliveries and their status.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Receive automatic notifications based on seismic activity, weather changes, and drone status.
- **Analytics**: Data-driven insights into drone performance, delivery success rates, and disaster recovery effectiveness.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js (MERN Stack)
  - Redux for state management
  - Google Maps API for tracking drone locations
  - Socket.io for real-time updates
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express.js
  - MongoDB for storing mission data, drone status, and delivery logs
  - Socket.io for real-time communication between frontend and backend
  - Drone API for controlling drones, receiving telemetry data, and adjusting flight paths
  - Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for live weather data integration
  - Seismic Sensor API for detecting seismic activities and integrating with the system
- **Other Tools**:
  - GPS Integration for precise location tracking
  - Satellite Data API (e.g., NASAâ€™s EOSDIS) for disaster monitoring and detection

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- Built using React.js to provide an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- Google Maps API integrated for real-time visual tracking of drones.
- Socket.io-client used to receive real-time updates from the backend.

### Backend
- Node.js with Express handles API requests and integrates with the drone API.
- MongoDB stores real-time drone data, mission logs, and delivery statuses.
- Socket.io handles real-time data streaming to the frontend.
- The system integrates with external APIs (weather, seismic sensors, etc.) to collect real-time data and optimize flight paths.

### Data Flow
1. **Disaster Detection**: The system receives disaster alerts from seismic and weather sensors.
2. **Drone Dispatch**: Drones are dispatched to specific locations based on the disaster zone and flight path optimization.
3. **Real-Time Tracking**: Drones' locations are tracked in real time using GPS, with updates provided to the frontend via Socket.io.
4. **Supply Delivery**: Drones deliver supplies, and their status (delivered, pending, delayed) is updated and tracked in real-time.
5. **Post-Mission Analytics**: Data on drone performance, delivery success, and mission efficiency is stored for analysis.

## Installation
